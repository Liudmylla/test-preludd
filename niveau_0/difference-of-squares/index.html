    <h1>Difference Of Squares</h1>
    <p>
      Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the
      squares of the first N natural numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is (1 + 2 + ... +
      10)² = 55² = 3025. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers
      is 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385. Hence the difference between the square of
      the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the
      first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
